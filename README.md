# FilmQueryProject



<h2>Description</h2>
This Film Query Project is designed as a console based application that allows users to search for films stored in a database by either film ID or a keyword. The application displays detailed information about films, including the title, description, release year, language, and list of actors. It's an easy-to-use tool, perfect for anyone interested in exploring a film database interactively.


<h2>Tech Used</h2>
<strong>Java:</strong> The primary programming language used to implement the application logic.
<strong>JDBC:</strong> Java Database Connectivity API used for connecting to the database and executing SQL queries.
<strong>MySQL:</strong> The relational database management system where film data is stored and retrieved from.
<strong>Git:</strong> Version control system for tracking changes in the source code during development.


<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<strong>Through this project, I've gained a solid understanding of:</strong>

Writing Java methods to handle database operations with JDBC.
Managing SQL queries and understanding the importance of database indexing for performance.
Exception handling in Java to make the application more robust and user friendly.
The importance of clean and readable code, which makes it easier to maintain and update the application.
The practical use of loops and conditionals to handle user input and control the flow of the application.
